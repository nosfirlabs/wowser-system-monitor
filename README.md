# wowser-system-monitor
a script that can monitor and display the system resource usage

To use this script, compile it using the gcc compiler and then run the resulting executable file. The script will display the current CPU, memory, and disk usage of the system.

For example, to compile and run the script, you can use the following commands:

>gcc resource_monitor.c -o resource_monitor
>./resource_monitor

This will display the current system resource usage in the console. You can also modify the script to display the usage at regular intervals by adding a loop and a sleep function to the code.
